Abstract
This paper investigates the Magnus Effect, the aerodynamic phenomenon responsible for the curved motion of spinning balls in sports such as baseball, soccer, and cricket. The study explores the basic mechanisms and explanations of the Magnus Effect using Bernoulli’s Principle and boundary layer behaviour. The study also combines theoretical analysis with datadriven comparison using established aerodynamic models from Nathan (2008), Sawicki et al. (2003), and Adair (2002). The Magnus force is mathematically expressed as 𝐹 𝑀 =
2 𝜌𝐶 𝐿 1 𝐴𝑣 2 , where the lift coefficient 𝐶 𝐿 depends on the spin parameter 𝑆 = 𝜔𝑅 𝑣 . Using experimental data, the paper compares the trajectories of spinning and non-spinning baseballs, demonstrating that increased spin rate enhances lateral deflection while higher velocity at constant spin reduces it. These findings confirm that the Magnus Effect is governed by the interplay between spin and velocity rather than either factor alone.
